**Abstract:**

Relative sea-level rise (RSLR) and tidal amplification threaten the incredibly flat landscape of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta. Much of this region, which is home to ~57 million people, lies within a few meters of sea level and is dominated by strong semi-diurnal tides that extend >200 km inland. While these tides inherently convey the threat of rising water level, they also convey ~330 Mt of sediment annually from the GBM river mouth which offers hope through vertical aggradation of the land. Though, this sediment supply is threatened by upstream damming which complicates an already uncertain future. Understanding the long-term outlook for the GBM requires a generalizable approach for exploring these vast uncertainties. Using a simple mass balance model of elevation change, we find that present rates of aggradation across the delta (1 to 4 cm/yr) easily exceed RSLR (2 to 4 mm/yr) through a dynamic equilibrium with an annual 0.011 factor increase in mean tidal range (MTR). Furthermore, this tidal amplification increases the effect of the 18.61 yr lunar nodal oscillation on aggradation by a factor of four. We also consider the long-term state behavior of the delta by exploring the parameter space (equilibrium elevation) created by MTR, RSLR, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). We find much of the delta to be quite stable and robust to RSLR with MTR being the dominant control assuming adequate SSC. However, equilibrium elevations decrease rapidly below SSCs of 0.1 g/L. Within the geospatial context of the delta, we find at lower sediment loads (â‰¤ 25% of present) and higher RSLR (>15 mm/yr), parts of the western delta begin to drown and the extent of tidal influence shifts seaward which may increase the potential for upstream catastrophic river avulsions. While these results offer optimism for the future of the GBM delta, they also identify problematic thresholds that exist within the range of possible outcomes driven by climate change and the geopolitical dispute between India and Bangladesh.
