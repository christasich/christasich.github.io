I am a researcher with interests in climate change adaptation, climate mitigation, and coupled natural and human systems. My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on understanding the threat of sea level rise to the low-lying landscape of the lower Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta. Much of my work combines collecting environmental information through field research which I use to simulate the evolution of the landscape elevation of the delta. From this, I gain insights into the spatial resilience of the delta which can be used to prioritize strategies for mitigating the inevitable impact of sea level rise.
